# [392 Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or `false` otherwise.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

## Examples

### Example 1

```markdown
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

### Example 2

```markdown
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```
